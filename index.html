          <h3>Why embroidery?</h3>
          <h2>Embroidery</h2>
          <p>
            Embroidery, often referred to as stitching, is the art of decorating
            fabric with a needle and thread to create intricate patterns and
            designs. It's a versatile craft that has been practiced for
            centuries and remains popular for its ability to blend creativity
            with practicality. Starting with embroidery is a fantastic choice
            because it's accessible for beginners, requiring only a few basic
            tools, yet offers endless opportunities for growth and
            experimentation.

            This hobby is not only a great way to unwind and practice
            mindfulness, but it also allows you to express your personal style.
            You can transform plain items like clothing, bags, or home textiles
            into unique, personalized creations. Plus, the sense of
            accomplishment that comes from completing a piece is incredibly
            rewarding. Whether you're making heartfelt gifts, adding flair to
            your wardrobe, or simply enjoying the meditative process, stitching
            is a fulfilling activity that combines art, relaxation, and utility
